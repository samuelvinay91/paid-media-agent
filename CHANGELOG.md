- Deterministic period comparisons and HTML/PDF reports with source reconciliation.

  Slack adapter, and optional Postgres persistence.
- Runtime skills and editable business context shared across both deployment paths.
- Vertex AI model providers (`google_vertexai`, `google_anthropic_vertex`) through the `vertex`
